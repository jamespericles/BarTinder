### <a name="Description"></a>Description
BarTinder is a web application that serves up cocktails in a unique way. Users are able to import ingredients into the "My Bar" section and BarTinder will deliver recipes based on what ingredients the user has. Users can swipe right on ingredients they are interested in, left on the ones they aren't, or up to favorite a recipe. Each recipe is presented with several images of the cocktail, a description, and a history section. If users so choose, they are able to search for recipes specifically rather than swiping through what can be made based on their ingredients. As users craft more drinks, "My Bar" will update live and provide the user with a warning as they start to run low on different ingredients.

BarTinder is meant for users with a love for cocktails but would like to not need to keep track of their ingredients. It also is for those who may want to try something new but are unsure of where to find quality recipes.
